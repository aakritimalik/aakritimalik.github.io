**Is psychotherapy the same as counselling?**

Counselling involves limited sessions which address dealing with everyday problems and issues such as life stresses, skills to manage anger or become assertive, to name a few. Psychotherapy on the other hand is a long- term process primarily dealing with clinical mental health issues which could be either acAQute or chronic for instance behavioural addictions, illnesses involving mood changes, depression, anxiety concerns. 

**How can psychotherapy help me?**

Psychotherapy is a process which can take a couple of sessions for you to see its effects. However, the very first three sessions can help you understand and gain clarity over – your current obstacles, your internal and external resources, compatibility with the psychologist and whether you can see yourself growing in the space.

**How do I know it is working?**

You’ll know that psychotherapy is working when you’ll start noticing newer perspectives, shifting habit patterns and changes in situations around you, within you, such as ability to identify thought processes, reflecting on your behaviours and possible feelings behind it among many other things.  

**How do I begin psychotherapy?**

If you have been thinking of initiating psychotherapy for a while, you are at the right place. The very fact that you came here tells me that you are ready to book your first session. From there on, the space is all yours to talk about all that has been bothering you and together we shall find ways to address your concerns, one session at a time.  

**How do I know if you are the right therapist for me?**

You are welcome to schedule an initial session with me to assess if I’m the right match for your concerns and needs. Additionally, some of my clients choose to read my newsletters, join some of my workshops, or read my blog posts before deciding if my work connects with them or not. 

**How many sessions will I need?**

The length of the course of psychotherapy sessions varies for each individual and the concerns they bring to the therapist. Ideally the initial treatment (initial 3 sessions) involves history taking and understanding of your core concerns, expectations from therapy, clarification of possible doubts and reservations around therapy along with signing of informed consent and creating a plan for future therapy sessions. Once you and I mutually agree that we make a good fit we can continue to proceed with our sessions towards your goals. 

**What if you are not the right fit for me or if I wish to work with you but you do not have the expertise in the area I’m willing to work in?**

No problem at all, in such a case I shall be more than happy to refer you to a suitable therapist  based on your requirements. 

**When do I stop my therapy sessions?**

The decision to stop sessions is usually a mutual process where both you and I shall evaluate your concerns and how you feel about it at present. Ultimately, psychotherapy is your sacred space and you decide what to do with it. In my sessions with clients, the space to discuss stopping the sessions is always open. 

**What if I decide to have sessions with you but wish to take a break?**

Absolutely! That is always possible and in fact encouraged, if and when you feel up to it. Most of the clients I work with begin seeing me for weekly sessions and slowly graduate towards fortnightly sessions followed by monthly check-ins, if and when we both feel they are ready for the same. Some of them choose to take a break of month or two and then resume their inner work again. 

**I want to work with you, however I cannot afford your fee, do you give any discounts?**

I’m so glad to know that you are eager to work with me. I do provide some discount in case you wish to book a 6 session package and pay for it in advance. 
Now and then, I may offer sessions at a sliding scale fee. Kindly check with me for the same. 

**I’m a student willing to work with you, however I cannot afford your fee. Can I still get any help?**

Of course you can! It takes courage to ask for help and I’m so glad you are brave enough to do that.
I offer workshops and webinars ( discounted prices for students) which involve discussion of various skills and tools to use when dealing with overwhelming emotions. Additionally, I would encourage you to subscribe to my fortnightly newsletter to keep your inner work going. 

**I tried counselling / psychotherapy once but was very disappointed, how can I re-consider starting it again?**

I’m sorry to learn that your experience with the counsellor/ therapist wasn’t helpful. It takes immense strength to ask for help especially after having a bitter experience with a counsellor. The fact that you found yourself here tells me you carry that strength in you. I’d be happy to hear your concerns, anxieties and reservations around resuming sessions and offer you a secure and a non-judgmental space to address them. The decision to continue your sessions with me or another therapist shall be yours.  

**Do you prescribe medications as well?**

No, I’m neither trained nor licensed to prescribe medications. Kindly consult your GP or a Psychiatrist for the same.
