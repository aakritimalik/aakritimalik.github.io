Hello and welcome!

My name is Aakriti Malik, and I am a licensed Clinical Psychologist with a decade of experience helping adults with a wide range of psychological difficulties. My areas of expertise include inner child healing, anxiety, depression, migration adjustment, grief and loss, emotional disturbances, relationship difficulties, life transitions, women's health issues, and trauma work. 

Prior to my current work in private practice in Auckland, New Zealand, I have had the privilege of working in prominent organizations in India and Malaysia. In Auckland, I have worked at Middlemore Hospital and Auckland City Hospital, gaining valuable experience in the field.

In addition to providing psychotherapy, I am passionate about mentoring and supporting young psychologists in their professional development. Please visit the supervision page to learn more about this aspect of my work.
 

## Approach to psychotherapy

My approach in psychotherapy involves offering a warm, non-judgmental and a compassionate space for you to feel secure enough to discuss your concerns. Being a trauma-informed therapist, I follow a client-centred and holistic framework, believing in your innate potential for growth and problem-solving. In our collaborative work in psychotherapy, you will see me utilise and incorporate tools and concepts from attachment theory, compassion based therapy, breath- work, CBT, DBT, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Internal Family Systems Therapy, Gestalt and Psychodynamic approaches to skilfully navigate through your concerns.

During our sessions, I will focus on the affirmative, explorative, informative, and corrective domains of supervision to provide you with a well-rounded space to enhance your skills and knowledge.

If you're seeking a supportive and growth-oriented supervision space, I would be delighted to work with you. Please feel free to book a free 10-minute consultation with me at aakritimcounselling@outlook.com.

**For psychologists from India: Iâ€™m currently running an on-line monthly group supervision for Practicing Psychologists. Mail me to express interest to join. Spaces open!**

Together, we will navigate through both personal and professional aspects of your psychotherapeutic work with your clients. I use a structured and process-oriented approach to help you chart your growth and development as a mental health professional in a flexible and personalized way.

During our sessions, I will focus on the affirmative, explorative, informative, and corrective domains of supervision to provide you with a well-rounded space to enhance your skills and knowledge.
