## Approach to Therapy
My approach in psychotherapy involves offering a warm, non-judgmental and a compassionate space for the client to feel secure enough to discuss their concerns. Being a trauma-informed therapist, I follow a humanistic and holistic framework and truly believe in the innate potential of each client to solve the most troubling of their concerns. My recent trainings include Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Depression and Anxiety Disorders, EMDR (Level 1), and Internal Family Systems Therapy. In my work with clients, I use an eclectic approach which finds me utilising components of attachment theory, compassion based therapy, CBT, DBT, ACT, Gestalt and psychodynamic work based on the needs of my clients.
