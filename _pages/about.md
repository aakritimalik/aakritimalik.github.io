Aakriti Malik is registered Clinical Psychologist with the New Zealand Psychologist Board and Rehabilitation Council of India. She has worked as a lecturer in public and private universities in India and Malaysia. Her research interests have been diverse - ranging from bullying in schools, history of hysteria to client expectations from mental health professionals. Her recent publications include work on shame, self-love and compassion based practices in psychotherapy.

## Approach to Therapy
My approach in psychotherapy involves offering a warm, non-judgmental and a compassionate space for the client to feel secure enough to discuss their concerns. Being a trauma-informed therapist, I follow a humanistic and holistic framework and truly believe in the innate potential of each client to solve the most troubling of their concerns. My recent trainings include Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Depression and Anxiety Disorders, EMDR (Level 1), and Internal Family Systems Therapy. In my work with clients, I use an eclectic approach which finds me utilising components of attachment theory, compassion based therapy, CBT, DBT, ACT, Gestalt and psychodynamic work based on the needs of my clients.
