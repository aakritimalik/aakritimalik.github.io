Hello and welcome!

My name is Aakriti Malik, and I am a licensed Clinical Psychologist with a decade of experience helping adults with a wide range of psychological difficulties. My areas of expertise include inner child healing, anxiety, depression, migration adjustment, grief and loss, emotional disturbances, relationship difficulties, life transitions, women's health issues, and trauma work. 

Prior to my current work in private practice in Auckland, New Zealand, I have had the privilege of working in prominent organizations in India and Malaysia. In Auckland, I have worked at Middlemore Hospital and Auckland City Hospital, gaining valuable experience in the field.

In addition to providing psychotherapy, I am passionate about mentoring and supporting young psychologists in their professional development. Please visit the supervision page to learn more about this aspect of my work.
 

## Approach to psychotherapy

My approach in psychotherapy involves offering a warm, non-judgmental and a compassionate space for you to feel secure enough to discuss your concerns. Being a trauma-informed therapist, I follow a client-centred and holistic framework, believing in your innate potential for growth and problem-solving.

In our collaborative work in psychotherapy, you will see me utilise and incorporate tools and concepts from attachment theory, compassion based therapy, breath- work, CBT, DBT, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Internal Family Systems Therapy, Gestalt and Psychodynamic approaches to skilfully navigate through your concerns.

I am committed to  my own self-work and life-long learning,  by attending professional development trainings and completing additional certifications to keep myself abreast with the latest developments in the field, so as to offer you the very best of evidence-based practices in therapy.

I look forward to connecting with you and supporting you with the next step in your healing journey.


## Approach to Supervision

My approach in supervision is to create an open, warm, non-judgmental and explorative space for you to connect with your innate wisdom and potential as a Mental Health Professional. In this relationship, we shall navigate through your personal and professional aspects of your psychotherapeutic work with your clients in a structured as well as process- oriented manner, allowing you to chart your growth in your professional development in a flexible manner.

The sessions shall emphasise upon the affirmative, explorative, informative and corrective domains in supervision, giving you an all-round space to hone your skills.

If this sounds like a supervision space youâ€™re looking for, I would be delighted to support you in your professional development.
