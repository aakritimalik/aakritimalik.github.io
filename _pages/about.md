Hello and welcome!

My name is Aakriti Malik, and I am a licensed Clinical Psychologist with a decade of experience helping adults with a wide range of psychological difficulties. My areas of expertise include inner child healing, anxiety, depression, migration adjustment, grief and loss, emotional disturbances, relationship difficulties, life transitions, women's health issues, and trauma work. 

Prior to my current work in private practice in Auckland, New Zealand, I have had the privilege of working in prominent organizations in India and Malaysia. In Auckland, I have worked at Middlemore Hospital and Auckland City Hospital, gaining valuable experience in the field.

In addition to providing psychotherapy, I am passionate about mentoring and supporting young psychologists in their professional development. Please visit the supervision page to learn more about this aspect of my work.
 

## Professional services

### Psychotherapy 
At my practice, I provide a warm, non-judgmental, culturally sensitive, and compassionate space where you can discuss your concerns safely. As a trauma-informed therapist, my approach follows a client-centered and holistic framework, rooted in the belief that you possess the innate potential for growth and problem-solving. I offer both brief and long-term psychotherapy, depending on your individual needs.

In my work, I integrate various tools and skills from attachment theory, compassion-based therapy, breathwork, Internal Family Systems (IFS) Therapy, CBT, DBT, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Gestalt, and Psychodynamic approaches. This integrative approach enables me to skillfully navigate through your concerns, finding the best tools and techniques to support your unique healing journey.

If you are seeking a therapist who can provide a supportive, personalized, and integrative approach to therapy, I would be delighted to work with you. Please feel free to book a free 15-minute consultation with me at aakritimcounselling@outlook.com.

Available for both online and in-person sessions. In-person session in central Auckland.

### For Organisations and Corporates
I offer a variety of experiential-based workshops on a range of topics. If you are interested in learning more about my workshops or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via email.

I am passionate about working with small to large groups, and I welcome collaboration on new ideas for workshops. If you have an idea in mind and would like to explore the possibility of working together, please feel free to contact me. I would be delighted to hear from you and discuss further.



## Approach to Supervision

My approach to supervision is to create an open, safe, supportive, and non-judgmental space where you can explore your potential as a Mental Health Professional. Together, we will navigate through both personal and professional aspects of your psychotherapeutic work with your clients. I use a structured and process-oriented approach to help you chart your growth and development as a mental health professional in a flexible and personalized way.

During our sessions, I will focus on the affirmative, explorative, informative, and corrective domains of supervision to provide you with a well-rounded space to enhance your skills and knowledge.

If you're seeking a supportive and growth-oriented supervision space, I would be thrilled to work with you. Please feel free to book a free 10-minute consultation with me at aakritimcounselling@outlook.com.
